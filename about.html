        <p><span>Hi I'm Divya and I am an artist.</span> Art, to me, is not about perfection, it's the way it makes you feel, be it happiness, a satisfaction or even sadness. To draw simply doesnt mean to fill it with colors and lines, it's not that simple. To me, it,s an expression, it,s a reflection of how you feel things and how you see the world, it's an interpretation of what you think. so when youre drawing something, you have to put a lot of effort in it. The finer your strokes are, the more effort you have put into it. You invest all your effort, time, creativity, thoughts and what not to make it exactly the way you wanted it to be. People look at the picture and they love what they see and what they feel and they praise the artist's work all the time but what they do not understand is that behind every single stroke there's a hidden meaning, a mystery I would say. You never know what the artist was thinking when one particular stroke was made, you never know how the artist felt at the beginning of it, you never know how emotional the artist was, how much time the artist has put in it to deliver his final emotions in a proper way. So, I feel that every stroke has its own story and all those stories are unique and most of the viewers out there do not understand the importance of one single stroke. </p>

            <p>
                Talking about the emotions involved, I cannot explain the satisfaction and the peace it gives me! When I look at the drawing and look at every single stroke and colors and line, it gives me a feeling of acheievement. As I've mentioned before, its not about perfetion. I can point out so many flaws in the drawing but I dont feel like making it right because I know how and what I felt when I was drawing that one particular stroke.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When I think about all of this, all I could relate is art and life. Strokes are the decisions we make, the result is the drawing which depends entirely on the stroke. Throughout this journey of life, you make mistakes which cannot be erased, you go through a lot of ups and downs, you feel so many emotions and afer you go through all this when you get the result, you often concentrate on the flaws and you forget to see the beauty of the entire result. You forget about what you learnt throughout the journey, all that patience, perseverance and so many other lessons. No matter how many flaws are there, the story is still yours, and your story is unique. you should learn how to love your story and the result despite the fact that there are flaws because your journey matters.
